This is my first independent project after learning Javascript. Besides JS, I use jQuery for functionality and SASS for styling. 

Please take the following into account when trying-out the page:
* When the page loads, it shows a beginner-level grid. Nevertheless, you can switch between intermediate and beginner levels as you wish. If you havenÂ´t play minesweeper before, you can follow the instructions on the left of the screen or look at an extended version of them [`here`](http://www.freeminesweeper.org/help/minehelpinstructions.html).
* To reset the game, you have to click on the face icon at the top of the table.
* This web project is not responsive. It looks better on medium-size screens.
